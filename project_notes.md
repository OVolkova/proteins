# Plan

1. + Business understanding:
   - understand task
   - read(scan) papers about data
2. + Data Understanding:
   - data report
   - data analysis
3. Base Model:
   - + take existing pipeline from torch geometrics
   - + set up training code structure to share for other models
   - set up GPU training
   - train model
4. Implement from scratch Model:
   - check leader shipboard and select paper to implement (by citations and authors)
   - read paper
   - select implementation framework
   - implement paper
   - train model
5. 3N attention Model:
   - + implement sparse 3N attention version
   - train model
   - prepare report and analysis


# Next steps:
- make commits more often!
- set up GPU training 
- train model Base Model
- train model 3N attention Model
